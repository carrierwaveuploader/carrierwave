module CarrierWave

  ##
  # This module simplifies manipulation with vips by providing a set
  # of convenient helper methods. If you want to use them, you'll need to
  # require this file:
  #
  #     require 'carrierwave/processing/vips'
  #
  # And then include it in your uploader:
  #
  #     class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  #       include CarrierWave::Vips
  #     end
  #
  # You can now use the provided helpers:
  #
  #     class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  #       include CarrierWave::Vips
  #
  #       process :resize_to_fit => [200, 200]
  #     end
  #
  # Or create your own helpers with the powerful vips! method, which
  # yields an ImageProcessing::Builder object. Check out the ImageProcessing
  # docs at http://github.com/janko-m/image_processing and the list of all
  # available Vips options at
  # https://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current/using-cli.html for more info.
  #
  #     class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  #       include CarrierWave::Vips
  #
  #       process :radial_blur => 10
  #
  #       def radial_blur(amount)
  #         vips! do |builder|
  #           builder.radial_blur(amount)
  #           builder = yield(builder) if block_given?
  #           builder
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # === Note
  #
  # The ImageProcessing gem uses ruby-vips, a binding for the vips image
  # library. You can find more information here:
