class <%= class_name %>Uploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  # Include RMagick, MiniMagick, or Vips support:
  # include CarrierWave::RMagick
  # include CarrierWave::MiniMagick
  # include CarrierWave::Vips

  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url(*args)
  #   # For Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
  #   # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))
  #
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]
  # end

  # Add an allowlist of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_allowlist
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

  # Add a content_type_allowlist to restrict uploads by MIME type.
  # Without it, a user could upload a harmful file
  # with a safe extension (content-type spoofing).
  # For the previous extension_allowlist you might use something like this:
  # def content_type_allowlist
  #   /image\//
  # end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg"
  # end
end
